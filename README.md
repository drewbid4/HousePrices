## Goal
Generally, predict sales prices and practice feature engineering, RFs, and gradient boosting. More specifically, predict the sales price for each house (SalesPrice variable). The evaluation metric is the Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price.
